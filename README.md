# React-Webpack-Babel-Stater

## Getting Up and Running

1) Clone repo <br />
a) If you have already set up a ssh key pair between your current computer and your git hub account, use the following command:
```
> $ git clone git@github.com:phamcharles/react-webpack-babel-starter.git
```
b). If you have NOT set up a ssh key pair, use the following command which will prompt you to enter your github username/password:
```
> $ git clone https://github.com/phamcharles/react-webpack-babel-starter.git
```

2) Change directory into the react-webpack-babel-starter directory/repository
```
> $ cd react-webpack-babel-starter
```

3) Install the project's dependencies
```
> $ npm install
```

4) Run the application
```
> $ npm start
```

5) `Word of Advice` <br/>
In the beginning, for now,
- just focus on writing your react code! It starts in the following files:
```
./index.html
./src/index.jsx
```

- take for granted that the following tools:
```
webpack is running and building your react code.
babel is allowing you to write ES6 code
```

- ignore and do not worry about the following files:
```
./.babelrc
./.editorconfig
./webpack.config.js
./webpack.loaders.js
./webpack.production.config.js
```
